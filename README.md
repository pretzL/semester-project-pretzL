[Community Science Museum](https://csm-pretzl.netlify.app/) is a museum homepage I created for my Semester Project 1 at Noroff.

## Description

Community Science Museum is a project I created based on the Semester Project 1 brief given by Noroff. It includes static text content for various exhibitions and events at a local museum. In line with this, I set out to create a site which is both inviting for inquisitive children, as well as a site engaging for their parents.

The main features are:

- Fully responsive
- HTML, CSS and JavaScript based
- Live opening hours feature showing the opening hours for the current day of the week

## Built With

- Vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## Getting Started

This project is already fully deployed, so there is no extra work required. Should you still want to deploy it yourself, follow the below steps.

### Installing

First off, clone the repo.

1. Clone the repo:

```bash
gh repo clone pretzL/semester-project-pretzL
```

2. Upload and install to your preferred hosting provider.

This is usually done through the hosting's own file manager or via FTP. Check which one you should use through your hosting provider.

### Running

So long as you have uploaded the provided files and deployed it to a website, the project should be running and fetching content from the WordPress Headless CMS.
